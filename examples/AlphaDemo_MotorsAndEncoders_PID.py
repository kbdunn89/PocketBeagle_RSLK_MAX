The goal of this file is to read rpm from the motors, and according to the current 
motor RPM and the desired RPM, the appropriate motor RPM is set. The logic used to
figure out the appropriate motor RPM is done by a PID controller. For now only the 
P part is being used.

	this loop consistently runs so that the appropriate motor RPM is constantly being 
	calculated
	
	to start the calculateRPM() function is called. This function calculates the current
	motor RPM's. The values are stores in rpm1(left motor) and rpm2(right motor)
	
	the value of the two motors RPM's are printed
	
	the error between the set RPM and the current motor RPM is then calculated
	this error value is passed to the PID function where it is used to calculate the P
	value. This gets us the correct PID value to be used in the new motor RPM calculations
	
	depending on the value of the set RPM, the designated left and right PWM values are set
	if the set RPM is 0 then the set PWM is 0
	
	if not then the left and right PWM values are calculated based on the current PWM and the 
	calculation done for the variation needed in the PWM to get the desired RPM
